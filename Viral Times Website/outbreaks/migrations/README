# Outbreaks Migrations

This folder contains Django migration files for the **Outbreaks app**.  
Migrations track changes to the database schema over time as models evolve.

## Contents
- **0001_initial.py** – Initial schema for outbreaks
- **0002_report.py** – Added the report model
- **0003_report_link.py** – Introduced link between outbreaks and reports
- **0004_outbreak_file_name.py** – Updated outbreak model with file name field
- **__init__.py** – Marks this directory as a Python package
- **__pycache__/** – Auto-generated cache files (ignored in Git)

These files allow Django to apply, roll back, and synchronize database changes consistently.
