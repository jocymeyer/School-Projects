# Viraltimes Project Core

This folder contains the **core configuration** for the Viral Times Django project.  
It defines how the entire project is set up and how all apps (such as the Outbreaks app) are connected.

## Contents
- **settings.py** – Global configuration for the project (installed apps, middleware, database, static files, etc.)
- **urls.py** – Root URL routing that connects requests to app-specific URL patterns
- **wsgi.py** – WSGI entry point for deployment on traditional servers
- **asgi.py** – ASGI entry point for asynchronous deployment (e.g., WebSockets, async workers)
- **__init__.py** – Marks this directory as a Python package
- **__pycache__/** – Auto-generated files (ignored in Git)

This folder serves as the **control center** of the Viral Times project, coordinating all apps and settings.
