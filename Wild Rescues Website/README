# Wild Rescues Website

**Role:** Designer & Developer  
**Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  

Wild Rescues is a multi-page responsive website I designed and implemented as part of my web design coursework.  
It follows a non-profit theme for a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center, with structured navigation, multimedia integration, and a consistent design system.

## Features
- Multi-page responsive design (`Home`, `About`, `Partnership`, `Gallery`, `FAQs`, `Contact`)
- Mobile-first navigation with hamburger menu
- FAQ interactivity powered by JavaScript
- Gallery with accessible image/figure markup
- Media-rich pages with video, tables, and forms
- CSS media queries for tablet, desktop, and large screen layouts
