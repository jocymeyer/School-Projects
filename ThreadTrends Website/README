ThreadTrend is a multi-page website I fully designed and implemented as a long-form capstone project for responsive web design.  
The site showcases modern layout techniques, accessibility practices, and interactive features.

## Features
- Multi-page design (`Home`, `About`, `Community Hub`, `Gallery`, `FAQs`, `Contact`, plus template/archive pages)
- Responsive layout (mobile-first with CSS Flexbox & Grid)
- Accessible navigation (desktop menu + mobile hamburger)
- Dynamic elements:
  - FAQ interactivity powered by JavaScript
  - Community Hub with embedded trending fashion articles
- Consistent branding with custom CSS and typography
